# SQL -MySQL and Tableau





Conclusion: MySQL is an advanced feature, powerful and versatile relational database management system, I worked with basics queries, managing the data store in a reliable and efficient way, I have also learnt about the difficulties when writing down queries and how careful you need to state your queries. As a result I have created a EER diagram which shows an snowflake scheme, in this scheme shows different entities that represents a table and their different Cardinal relationships, I worked with the data of sql_store which shows the relationships between Customers, orders_ID, products, shippers and orders status.



Tools:MySQL,Reverse Engineer database.
